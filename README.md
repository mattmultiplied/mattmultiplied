## About Me
Graphic & Communication design graduate achieving BA (IND) 1st Class Honours at The University of Leeds. Alongside this, I am a self-taught developer working in both front-end and back-end development. Got a project in mind or just fancy a chat, send me a message and we can support our local Leeds coffee shops.
